    "Object tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, widely used in applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics. It involves locating an object in successive frames of a video, ensuring continuous tracking even when objects move, occlude, or change appearance.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will explore different object tracking techniques, their advantages, and when to use them."

    "## Object Tracking vs. Object Detection\n",
    "At first glance, object detection and object tracking may seem similar, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "`Object Detection`: Identifies and locates objects in a single frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Object Tracking`: Follows an object across multiple frames after an initial detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since detection is computationally expensive, it is often combined with tracking to improve efficiency. Tracking algorithms use prior motion and appearance information to locate objects in subsequent frames, reducing the need for frequent detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Object Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Optical Flow-Based Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dense Optical Flow`: Estimates motion vectors for every pixel in an image.\n",
    "- `Sparse Optical Flow`: Tracks key feature points instead of all pixels (e.g., Kanade-Lucas-Tomashi (KLT) tracker).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Kalman Filtering\n",
    "A powerful algorithm for predicting the location of a moving object using prior motion data. It is commonly used in applications like missile guidance and autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Mean-Shift and CamShift Tracking\n",
    "`Mean-Shift`: Locates the highest density of pixels within a given window.\n",
    "`CamShift (Continuously Adaptive Mean-Shift)`: An extension of Mean-Shift that adjusts window size dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Single Object Trackers\n",
    "These trackers are initialized with a bounding box in the first frame and track the object in subsequent frames. Popular trackers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MIL (Multiple Instance Learning)\n",
    "- CSRT (Discriminative Correlation Filter)\n",
    "- MOSSE (Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multiple Object Tracking with Re-Identification\n",
    "For tracking multiple objects, a combination of object detection and tracking is used. Some advanced tracking algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DeepSort: Uses deep learning for re-identification and tracking.\n",
    "- FairMOT: A state-of-the-art multi-object tracking algorithm that combines detection and tracking in a single framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Object Tracking?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Improves Performance\n",
    "Tracking is computationally cheaper than running object detection on every frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Handles Occlusion\n",
    "A robust tracking algorithm can continue tracking even when objects are temporarily occluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Maintains Object Identity\n",
    "Unlike detection, tracking assigns a unique ID to each object, ensuring consistency across frames."
