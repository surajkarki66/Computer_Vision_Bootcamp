    "# Mean Shift and Cam Shift\n",
    "Mean Shift and Cam Shift are similar techniques but yield different outcomes. Mean Shift provides simpler results; however, it struggles with handling rotations and adapting to changes in object size. In contrast, Cam Shift is more advanced and flexible, capable of managing rotations, size variations, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Mean Shift\n",
    "Mean Shift is a non-parametric algorithm used for clustering and mode-seeking(finding the most frequently occurring value in a dataset) in data. In object tracking, Mean Shift tracks an object by repeatedly adjusting a window to follow the object’s color distribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is simple and computationally efficient but it can not handle rotations and varying sizes. When computational resources are limited, Mean Shift can be considered for use instead of the Cam Shift algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Cam Shift\n",
    "Cam shift is an advanced version of Mean shift, it applies Mean shift first. It adjusts the tracking window size and orientation to follow objects that rotate or change size. It can detect objects in more complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires more computational resources when compared with Mean Shift.\n",

    "## Object Tracker with Cam shift and Mean shift\n",
    "Now it is time to create an object detector using these 2 algorithms. The main idea is quite simple: First user draws a rectangle to the interested area (object) with a mouse right-click and presses the ‘ESC’ key. After that, a new window appears, and the object is tracked within that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 1: The user defines the object by drawing a rectangle to the first frame of the video, the user presses the mouse right button for the first point pair and the same button for the second point pair.\n",

    "### STEP 2: The program detects the color of the object that the user selected.\n",
