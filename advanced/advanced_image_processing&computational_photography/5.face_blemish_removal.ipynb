    "Trying to construct a good method to identify a \"good\" region seems really difficult. There are multiple factors to consider, such as how big of a search region to include, how to determine proper textured regions vs incorrect nearby regions, how to optimize a search, whether to just search until you find one, or try to optimize, etc. So instead, I will build a tool similar to the Photoshop healing brush tool, where the user manually selects a better region. Personally, having used Photoshop, I actually prefer this method, as it gives the user more control. Plus, since I am more familiar with it, it'll be easier for me to implement."
